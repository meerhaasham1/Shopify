## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Handles page navigation within the app.
- **Redux**: Manages global state like cart contents.
- **Axios**: Fetches data from a mock API.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling components.

## How It Works

- **State Management**: Redux is used for managing the application state (e.g., shopping cart).
- **Fetching Data**: Products are fetched via API requests using Axios.
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS is used for styling components, with styles organized by component.
